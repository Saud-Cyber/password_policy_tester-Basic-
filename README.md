 Step-by-Step Guide (For README)

  How to Use This Project (Step-by-Step)

Follow these simple steps to test password strength using intercepted login requests:

---

 Step 1: Clone or Download the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-policy-tester.git
cd password-policy-tester


---

 Step 2: Intercept a Login Request with Burp Suite

1. Open Burp Suite → Go to Proxy > Intercept → Make sure Intercept is ON.


2. Open any web app with a login form (e.g., DVWA, test page).


3. Enter any credentials and click login.


4. In Burp, right-click the intercepted request → Copy to file or Copy raw request.


5. Paste it into a file named request.txt inside the project folder.



>  Make sure the request includes something like password=... in the body.




---

 Step 3: Run the Python Script

python3 password_tester.py

The script will:

Read the intercepted request

Automatically extract the password and URL

Check if the password follows good security practices

Suggest 3 strong passwords if the input is weak

Save a full report in a logs/log_1.txt, log_2.txt, etc.




---

 Step 4: View the Report

Open the generated log file:

cat logs/log_1.txt

You will see a complete analysis like this:

Password Analyzed: test123

 Strength Check:
- Length >= 8: 
- Uppercase: 
- Lowercase: 
- Number: 
- Special Character: 

 Final Verdict:  Weak Password

 Suggested Strong Passwords:
- Ab7!xLp90Qt#
- Tr3$Zmn42Kp@
- Gp#Lk7Wyq@8%

That's It!

You've now tested a password from a real intercepted login request and generated a detailed cybersecurity report.
You can repeat this with different intercepted requests and passwords.
